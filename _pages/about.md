Hey there, I am Ruining (Christine) Zhao, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Math, Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be a member of Data Mining Group (DMG) advised by Prof. Jiawei Han and the BLENDER lab advised by Prof. Heng Ji. Before joining DMG and Blender, I was a research intern at IDEA Lab advised by Prof. Hanghang Tong.

My current research interests are **Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, Knowledge graph**. More specifically, I am motivated by below questions:

- **Knowledge Extraction** How can we utilize structural knowledge to improve the reliability of LLMs (bottom-up approach)?

- **Knowledge Representations** How does symbolic science connect the linguistic and numeric worlds (bridge)?

- **R*easoning Paths** How can we enable language systems to think as human beings with the study of language acquisition (top-down approach)
