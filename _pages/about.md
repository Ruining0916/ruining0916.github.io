Hi, I am Ruining Zhao, Nice to meet you! I am a senior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studying Mathematics & Computer Science.



My research interests mainly lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowlegde graph and Data science with economics & policy. I am acitivily contributed to Blender Research Group with Professor Heng Ji , Idea lab with Professor Hanghang Tong and BDEEP group with Professor Peter Christensen.  In these research experience, I find a great passion to explore underlying connections between things and propose rigors models.

Find it boring to read all "Academic" staff?  I am good at solving emotion problems, and I enjoy chatting with people with a cup of coffee ☕️. I love sunshine, wind and birds singing at my window every morning. Besides that, I can play the piano, violin and Ukulele. If we can be friends in the further, I am more than excited about your stories. ☀️ss
