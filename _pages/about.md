Hey there! I am Ruining (Christine) Zhao, a first-year Master student in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I currently work with Prof. Alexander Schwing with exciting Video understanding with language grounding. I am also fortuante to be a member of [Data Mining Group (DMG)](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) advised by Prof. Jiawei Han and the [BLENDER lab](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/) advised by Prof. Heng Ji.

My current research interests are **Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, Knowledge graph and Foundemantal Machine Learning**. More specifically, I am motivated by below questions:

- **LLM Adaptation:** fundamental paradigm shift to current LLM training frameworks
- **Language + Vision** joint learning of vision concepts and lanaguge features for better image and video understanding
- **Beyond Language:** emotion and human behaviors understanding supported by reasoning and creative generation ability of LLMs
